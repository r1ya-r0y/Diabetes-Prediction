# Diabetes-Prediction
## Training Accuracy:

The model achieved an accuracy of 78.66% on the training data, indicating how well it fits the training set.


## Test Accuracy:

The accuracy on the test data is 77.27%, which is slightly lower than the training accuracy, suggesting a good generalization with minimal overfitting.




## Strong Positive Correlations:

Glucose and Outcome: Higher glucose levels are strongly associated with a positive diabetes outcome.

BMI and Outcome: Higher BMI is also positively correlated with diabetes.

## Moderate Positive Correlations:

Age and Pregnancies: Older individuals tend to have more pregnancies.

Insulin and SkinThickness: Higher insulin levels are moderately associated with thicker skin.

## Weak or No Correlations:

BloodPressure and Outcome: Blood pressure shows a weak correlation with diabetes outcome.

DiabetesPedigreeFunction and other variables: This function has weak correlations with most other variables.
